# Murder in the First
Minimalist text game based on law

##Synopsis
You are Jake Polomar, a criminal lawyer at Farron and Associates. You have been assigned the case of Janet Escobar, a student at Toronto Poly Tech. She has been accused of murder in the first degree of her boyfriend. She has come to you in tears and wants you to help her solve her case and clear her name.

Murder in the First is a metaphysical game, where some of the actions take place in the real world. You will be given papers and case materials, while also using a simulation to help solve her crime. Murder in the First is (what I hope to be) a part of a larger story, involving Jake Polomar and his life.
